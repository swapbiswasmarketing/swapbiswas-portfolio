/**
 * IndexNow: pick the URLs a deploy changed, prove ownership, announce them.
 *
 * Every function here is pure or takes its effects as arguments (`fetchImpl`, `now`,
 * `env`), which is what lets scripts/test-indexnow.mjs cover the whole module with no
 * network and no clock. Nothing in this file reads process.env or calls fetch on its
 * own - the callers (the astro.config.mjs hook and scripts/indexnow.mjs) inject both.
 *
 * Order of operations for a production deploy:
 *   1. resolveDeployContext() - is this a production deploy at all?
 *   2. parseSitemapEntries()  - read dist/sitemap-0.xml
 *   3. selectFreshUrls()      - keep URLs whose lastmod is inside the window
 *   4. verifyKeyFile()        - is the origin already serving the key?
 *   5. submitUrls()           - chunk, POST, classify
 *
 * Step 4 is the one that looks redundant and is not. See verifyKeyFile().
