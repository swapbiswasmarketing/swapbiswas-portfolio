/**
 * IndexNow CLI for swapbiswas.com
 *
 * The deploy hook in astro.config.mjs handles the normal case automatically. This is
 * for the cases it deliberately does not cover: checking the key is live, announcing a
 * URL by hand, re-announcing after a failed deploy, and seeing what the next deploy
 * would submit without submitting it.
 *
 * USAGE:
 *   node scripts/indexnow.mjs verify              Is the origin serving the key file?
 *   node scripts/indexnow.mjs status [--days N]   What WOULD be submitted
 *   node scripts/indexnow.mjs submit [--days N]   Announce recently changed URLs
 *   node scripts/indexnow.mjs submit --url URL    Announce one URL (probed first)
 *   node scripts/indexnow.mjs submit --all        Announce every URL in the sitemap
 *   node scripts/indexnow.mjs key                 Print the key and its public location
 *
 * Flags:
 *   --days N     override the freshness window (default: FRESH_WINDOW_DAYS)
 *   --url URL    submit exactly this URL, repeatable
 *   --all        ignore lastmod, submit everything in the sitemap
 *   --dry-run    print the payload, make no request
 *   --sitemap P  read a LOCAL sitemap from P instead of the live site
 *   --force      skip the liveness probe on --url (announce it anyway)
 *
 * URLS COME FROM THE LIVE SITE BY DEFAULT, not from dist/. A local build reflects the
 * working tree, which is routinely ahead of production, and announcing a built-but-not-
 * deployed URL points the engine at a 404. --sitemap opts back into a local file.
 *
 * `submit` is the only command that announces anything. It refuses to run until the
 * key file is live (announcing against a key the origin is not serving earns a 403),
 * and it probes any URL named with --url, since those bypass the sitemap and so bypass
 * the guarantee that a URL is deployed.

 * socket from fetch() is still open aborts the process on Windows:
 *   Assertion failed: !(handle->flags & UV_HANDLE_CLOSING), file src\win\async.c
 * and the shell sees exit code 127, not 1. Every failure path in this CLI is reached
 * immediately after a fetch, so that assertion is the NORMAL outcome of `verify`
 * against a site that is not yet serving the key - which is exactly the state this
 * command exists to report. Setting exitCode lets the loop drain and exits 1 cleanly.
